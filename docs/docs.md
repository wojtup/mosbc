# "Documentation"

Or rather bizarre list of random files roughly describing what was happening
throughout the development. Enjoy!

### VERY IMPORTANT THINGS:

- [review.md](review.md) - Review of code structure.
- [differences.md](differences.md) - List of all differences between MikeOS'
original implementation and this one.

### Compiler:

- [codegen_theory.md](codegen_theory.md) - Some explanation of how code
generator works.

### Parser:

- [grammar.ebnf](grammar.ebnf) - Something trying to be EBNF grammar.
- [parsing_theory.md](parsing_theory.md) - Some explanation of how parser works.

### Least useful:

- [list.md](list.md) - List of keywords for MikeOS.
- [node_info.md](node_info.md) - Basic info about how nodes are constructed.
