# "Documentation"

Or rather bizarre list of random files roughly describing what was happening
throughout the development. Enjoy!

### VERY IMPORTANT THINGS:

- [Code review](review.md) - Review of code structure.
- [Differences](differences.md) - List of all differences between MikeOS'
original implementation and this one.

### Compiler:

- ["Codegen Theory"](codegen_theory.md) - Some explanation of how code generator
works.

### Parser:

- [Grammar](grammar.ebnf) - Something trying to be an EBNF grammar.
- ["Parsing Theory"](parsing_theory.md) - Some explanation of how parser works.

### Least useful:

- [Keyword list](list.md) - List of keywords for MikeOS.
- [Node info](node_info.md) - Basic info about how nodes are constructed.
